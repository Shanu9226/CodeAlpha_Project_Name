Hangman Game
A simple command-line version of the Hangman game implemented in Python.

Description
This is a simple Hangman game where the player guesses letters to figure out a hidden word. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before losing the game. The game will continue until the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

Features
Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
Displays the word with blank spaces (_) for unguessed letters.
Tracks incorrect guesses and displays the number of attempts left.
Ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.
Requirements
Python 3.x (Tested with Python 3.7+)
Installation

Running the Game
Run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
python hangman.py
The game will prompt you to guess a letter. Enter a letter, and it will display the updated word and the number of remaining attempts.

Continue guessing until:

You guess all the letters correctly and win.
You run out of attempts and lose.
Game Flow
The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
You are shown blanks for each letter in the word.
You guess one letter at a time.
If the letter is in the word, it is revealed.
If the letter is not in the word, you lose an attempt.
The game continues until you either guess the word or exhaust all attempts.
